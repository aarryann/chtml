    post: "<p>Man I am glad you asked this question. I'm a 6 year old golden retriever and while I still have a few years left to experience, I think I've been around long enough to tell you what it's really like.</p><p>Most people think being a dog is awesome. You sleep as much as you want, all of your meals are prepared for you, and someone literally picks up your poop you. And yeah, you know what, those parts <em>are</em> pretty awesome. But there's a dark side to being a golden retriever that they don't tell you about…</p>",

    post: "<p>This is something most people wonder about themselves at least 4 or 5 times throughout their life. Everyone ignores you for weeks on end (including your immediate family) and the only person who will talk to you is a little boy you are treating because he thinks he sees dead people.</p><p>The fact is, you can't <em>really</em> know if you're just a weird dead ghost thing until the rest of the world finally decides to acknowledge you again.

We opened the box excited to take in the aroma of this incredible pie, but we were not prepared for what we saw. Instead of the pepperoni pizza we ordered, they had delivered us a…</p>",

    title: 'What would your pro wrestling finishing move be?',
    post: "<p>Great question. The first thing you need to decide is should your finishing move be something you do to hurt your opponent enough to then get the pin, or a submission move that causes your opponent to give up.</p><p>Personally, I've always found submission moves to be a lot less exciting than a powerbomb or a moonsault off the top rope. Sure there's a few classics that the crowd goes nuts for like the Sharpshooter, but most of them just don't get the same pop as a Tombstone or a Stone Cold Stunner. If I had to choose, my first choice would be…</p>",
